# -----------------------------
# In this file, we define the hosts that we want to manage with Ansible.
#
# We can also define groups of hosts, and use these groups to apply configurations to multiple hosts at once.
# 
# [myhosts] is a group that contains all the hosts that we want to manage with Liqo in order to perform the peering.
# local_node is the host where we are running the Liqo control plane.
